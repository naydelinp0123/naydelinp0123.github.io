For this past week what we have been doing or learning about is studying for the midterm test
for computer science and where you are at. Another thing that we did in class is figuring out 
what level you stand and what you need more work or what u would like to study more. One problem
that i had was that some of the problems in the midterm test i forgot how to solve it and some 
of the problems i didnt remember. one question that i have is why in problem #15 everyone choosed A 
and didn't really chose the other answers?
