This is an example of what I did in class for this whole week. So, for this 
week what we did was we had to create a flag with codes. somethings that i 
had trouble with was that i couldn't seem to get some of the codes right which 
made me almost messed up my entire flag but then i got some help and got to
finish it in time and made my norway flag.
