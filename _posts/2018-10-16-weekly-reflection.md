For this week what we did was to create a flag and try to remake the designs 
he gave us on the slides and if we use that information on how we created the flag 
then we could remake the flags we made and use codes to make our flag and one struggle that 
i had was that i wasnÂ´t their for one day and was lost but i got the 
hang of it and ot my work done.
