## Flag of Norwary by Naydelin Perez

## Describe your program

The flag that i created was the norway flag because norway seems really intersting and i really wanted to learn about the county's flag. 
The grade that i expect to is a 3 or a 4 because most of the code that i used was from what mr.allata thought us and i also tried really hard to get every inch right so it wouldn't look wrong.
