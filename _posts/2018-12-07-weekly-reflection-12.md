For this entire week what we have been doing is to make a flag that we got
and the flag that i got was norway and Mr.allata gave us a website called 
"fotw.info" and it gave you information about your flag and the history 
of the flag. and what i had problems with was that the ratio of the flag
and how big it should be and what excatly it looks like and the shaes that
are being used. on question that i have is that will this flag be able to
be formed in the computer?
