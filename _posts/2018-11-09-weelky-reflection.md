For this entire week what we learned was to how to use fast functions and how to create a gt function. 
And we also learned how to make it work in wescheme and we learned how to use examples so our 
functiong would work and there shouldn't be any problems with it. some problems that i had during the classes was that when i define it it wouldn't workbut then i fixed it and i got the function to work.
