Today in class mr.allata thought us how to use github and how we can create our own website and this week it insprired me to start my own website and create one. Even thoughbi faced a few challenges i got the hang of things and my website come out pretty well and i even learned how not to ask the teacher for help and just follow the steps he gave us.
