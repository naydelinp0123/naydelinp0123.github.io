for this entire week what we did was create functions and define images and 
find the definiations and we also tried to start and learn how to make our own game and
how to start it. some problems that i had was that at first when he told us about 
how to make our own value definitons and how  to make it appear in the "interaction" 
and how we could do that but then i go it and had no problem with it.
