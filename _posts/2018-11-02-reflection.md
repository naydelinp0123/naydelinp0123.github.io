This entire week what we have been learing about is contrasting and functions.
what we were doing wiht this is trying to figure out how to get an image with 
(bitmap/url"...") and the way we did that was that using that fuction on our
work in wescheme and how we used it for what to use it to create our own 
game :star2: . Some problems that i had was that some images that me and my partner used 
didn't want to work with the bitmap link.
