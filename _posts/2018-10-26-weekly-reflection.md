For this entire week what we did was create functions and define images and 
find the definiations of each experssion and we also tried to start and learn how
to make our own game and how to start it. Today what we did was do a packet with math 
and circles of evaluation. some problems that I had was that at
first when he told us about how to make our own value definitons and how 
to make it appear in the "interaction" and how we could do that but then 
I go it and had no problem with it.
